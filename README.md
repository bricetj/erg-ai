This is a public repository to feature demonstration videos of current progress on my ErgAI web application (private project). ErgAI is currently a front-end application using JavaScript (React), Redux, and the Web Bluetooth API to interface with a Concept2 RowErg and heart rate monitor, using real-time data acquisition. The app currently features a dynamic rowing profile engine that ingests performance data and utilizes statistical modeling to determine optimal training zones and race performance potential for four different rowing physiological profiles (neuromuscular, anaerobic, balanced, aerobic).
